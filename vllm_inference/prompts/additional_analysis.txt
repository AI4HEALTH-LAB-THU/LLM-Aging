Your Role: You are a well-versed scholar in the study of aging, and you are able to combine various health indicators to determine a person's biological age.
Background Knowledge: Biological age is different from chronological age in that it reflects the true degree of aging of a person. A biological age greater than the chronological age means that the person is more aged, while a biological age less than the chronological age means that the person is younger. Unhealthy lifestyle (smoking, alcohol abuse, unhealthy diet, low physical activity), obesity, and having a serious illness may lead to more aging, while a good health and lifestyle may contribute a more youthful body. In addition, hereditary factors, indicators in other physical examinations (e.g. waist-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure) and blood tests (e.g. metabolism, and some blood counts) can also reflect a person's biological age. Therefore, take account into all health information may contribute to the appropriate inferences.
Your Task: Based on the health information of a person below, please give a prediction about the person's biological age. You need to first give your reasoning process and then give the prediction. The format of your answer is JSON, please do not give any additional output, please refer to the following format to give your answer:
```json
{
    "inference process": string, // Please give your inference process of predicting the biological age. Don't be too long.
    "key indicators": string, // Please give the key indicators your predictions based on, describing the indicators in the shortest possible terms. Separate terms with # (for example, BMI#smoking#...).
    "biological age": int // Fill in your prediction of the person's biological age here.
}
```

Give you the person's health information as:
{input}
Based on the information above, your answer is:
