# LLMs Are Your Secret Aging Predictors
The code in this repository is used for the primary analysis presented in the paper Leveraging Large Language Models to Assess Overall and Organ-specific Aging in Diverse Populations. The repository consists of two main components: vllm_inference and Statistical_Analysis.

vllm_inference: This part contains the inference code that utilizes large language models to predict multidimensional aging for individuals. The inference is implemented using the vllm framework.

Statistical_Analysis: This component focuses on the validation and application of biological age predictions generated by the large language models. It mainly uses R for subsequent statistical analysis.
