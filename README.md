# LLMs Are Your Secret Aging Predictors
The code in this repository is used for the primary analysis presented in the paper ***Leveraging Large Language Models to Assess Overall and Organ-specific Aging in Large-scale General Populations***. The repository consists of two main components: **vllm_inference** and **Statistical_Analysis**.

**1.vllm_inference:** This part contains the inference code that utilizes large language models to predict multidimensional aging for individuals. The inference is implemented using the vllm framework.

**2.Statistical_Analysis:** This component focuses on the validation and application of biological age predictions generated by the large language models. It mainly uses R for subsequent statistical analysis.

For an overview of this study, see the figure below.
